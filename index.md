## Hi there. Welcome to my photo blog.

### I love to travel, take photos, and write about random things.

I aso love dogs and cats. I am a proud mama of two british shorthairs that are angels by night, devils by early morning. Back home I also have a courageous orange tabby and a super extroverted but insecure 1 year-old mountain dog.

I grew up in a small village filled with rice paddy fields in Taiwan, one of the most beautiful places on earth in my opinion. I have been living in Europe for more than 5 years now, and I do really miss the lush and massive mountain backdrops. I also miss being surrounded by the deep blueness of the Pacific, the heavy downpours ([sounds like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkFcANp-eLo&ab_channel=INDOVILLAGE)) and the [sounds of cicada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7ylgj2JlQ&ab_channel=CatTrumpet) that brings back fond memories.
