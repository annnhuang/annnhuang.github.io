First time in Bangkok! It was a wonderful family trip. I loved the warm and humid 30 deg. C weather, friendly hospitality and the absolutely amazing cuisine.

Upon arriving at the [Grande Centre Point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9gyUk3Z3ZK2JV35y6) the first night, we ordered dinner at the hotel because it was too late to go outside. The pad thai was very tasty and the coconut water was very refreshing.

After a really delicious breakfast buffet, we started the day visiting the [The National Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kk3jSuWGWfGqs9nx9) and the [The Grand Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6CHqk5MHnJEzkKyV9). This city is gilded with gold!

We walked around, got on the hop-on-hop-off boat and stopped by China Town to get delicious chicken rice for lunch. Then we headed back to the hotel and got some really nice massage right across from our hotel.

In the evening we walked across the river to a local restaurant called [Bangkok Chim Chum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1hPHQvfQgB6TMSwV6) with cozy vibe and great food.

After dinner we walked to [IconSiam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cXd83i9iXmF4N4Rh6), enjoyed the city night view and cute cats. We bought some snacks back to the hotel to continue enjoying the city's night lights.
