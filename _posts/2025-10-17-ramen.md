Probably the best ramen I have ever had. Located in [Scheidam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lnkx9nprZra57MLS9), the restaurant is super cozy with a really friendly service and a Japanese chef. Sometimes you can tell by the simple and homey-looking interior (as opposed to fancy decorations) that the food they serve must be delicious.
