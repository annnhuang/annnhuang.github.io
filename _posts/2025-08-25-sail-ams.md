What an epic line-up. 

I shot the photos using the [Birkenstock recipe](https://film.recipes/2024/09/02/birkenstock-flat-tones-for-photo-walks/) from film.recipes. It's not bad. I do like the soft, film-like and nostalgic look. But perhaps it is a bit dark for a cloudy day. So I still performed slight editing in post. Maybe this recipe is better for a brighter and sunlight rich day.
