First stop was coffee at [Ally Cat Bikes & Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MVB2NFgb6aLSFfUh6). Then walking around the city, enjoying the quiet Sunday morning. For lunch we went for dim sum at [Wen Chow](https://maps.app.goo.gl/67mNLHAd98tbxreP8), which I thought was amazing. Hayley was not too impressed though, she thinks Full Moon City in Den Haag is still the best.

Then we walked around a bit more, touring the city from west to east side across the river. Also visited the landmark [Helpoort](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LG3gLFVP2kUZRT1XA). This city's got some really cool vibes and I was really happy with how the photos turned out.
