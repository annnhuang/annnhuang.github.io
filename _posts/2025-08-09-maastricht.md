Road trip was fun. The highlight was stopping by Germany to get some groceries! How I miss the grocery prices in Germany! We decided in our hearts to take a cooler everytime we go near the broader or cross the broder to Germany ðŸ˜‚

The first stop was the [The North Caves](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zBHp3X9VgB4f3kvSA). The underground cave was super huge and the guided tour was quite interesting. It got slighly cold after an 1hr though.

Initially we picked Maastricht because of this taco place called [JUTOMATO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CG12m21Nw95Stm3o9) I really wanted to try. Having lived in Europe for more than 4 years now, I really miss the street tacos in Southern California. This restaurants boasts in its use of authentic Mexican ingredients for making the tacos and it's been really hyped up by social media. However, it was not as expected... as I shared in the reviews:

The pulled pork were a bit salty and dry. The tortillas were slightly too hard. The salsa was not spicy at all! However I really enjoyed the chips and guacamole, though the guacamole was a bit too sour. The ingredients overall tasted fresh and authentic. I generally enjoyed it, but if youâ€™re looking for somewhere that will satisfy your old SoCal street tacos cravings, this place still doesnâ€™t cut it in my opinion. But it could just be that Iâ€™ve never tried tacos in Mexico.

Then finally we arrived at the [Castle Vaeshartelt](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wMbbvamitjfgNc3V7) which dates back to the 18th century. From the outside, the estate looked pretty stunning. The road leading to the main entrance was surrounded by trees and made the castle all the more interesting with a royal feeling to it. There was a nice courtyard, along with a restaurant and bar with outdoor seating. However, while the exterior looks like a 5-star, the interior and the experience was more like a 2 or 3- star hostel...

We waited 40 min just for two simple cocktails like Gin and Tonic. One of the waiters kept talking to the guests while holding the drinks (therefore most likely inadvertently spitting into the drinks..), and overall the service was not attentive. In the room, the bed was extremely soft therefore our backs really hurt. There were only two pillows for two people. The shower room leaks water too. 

Anyway despite all these, we still enjoyed our time. Just that it was quite an experience. At least there was a cute cat.

For the photos, I used the Portra400 simulation. They turned out so amazing in my opinion. I love looking at these images!
