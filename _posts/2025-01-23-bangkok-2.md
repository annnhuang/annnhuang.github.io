The next day we visited the [Bangkokian museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dR9c54UFFtN1vS2Q9), which was quite impressive. The building dates back to the 1930s.

Then we also visited the [Nielson Hayes Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6kf4vRdqfaecFdhr9). This was free to enter, but videos and pictures not allowed.

For lunch we went to the Michelin-starred [Sri Trat Restaurant and Bar](https://guide.michelin.com/th/en/article/dining-out/8-michelin-listed-bangkok-restaurants-with-impressive-bars) that serves the best Thai cuisine! We had a great time there.

We also visited [Restaurant Ruen Urai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/stC1zZ9NVaVkWY1H7) for dinner. We didn't wait long and the service was excellent as usual in Thailand.

And what are the chances to see my colleague in Thailand at the same time!
